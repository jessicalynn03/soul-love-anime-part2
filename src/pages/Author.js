             <p>My Name is Lynn Muller. I created this blog to share my love for anime and to unite people who have a mutual love for anime. My love for Anime began at the young age of 9 years old. I was first introduced to anime by my older sister who took an interest in reading manga and then began watching anime. The first anime I ever watched was Naruto and Big O. If you are a fan of anime like me, this is a space where you can openly share your thoughts on the most recent animes to date.</p>
